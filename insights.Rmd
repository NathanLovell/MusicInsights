First, we need tidyverse to handle data imprting and wragling...
Then we can load datasets into variables for use later

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv") #avoid absolute paths
preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")

```


Cleaning dataframe column names
```{r}
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "First, we are going to create a pseudonym for you to keep this survey anonymous (more or less). Which pseudonym generator would you prefer?"] <- "generator_name"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "What is your pseudonym?"] <- "pseudonym"
```
colnames(survey)
